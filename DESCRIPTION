Description: Functions, examples and data from the book
 "Numerical Methods and Optimization in Finance" by M.
 Gilli, D. Maringer and E. Schumann (2011), ISBN
 978-0123756626. The package provides implementations of
 several optimisation heuristics, such as Differential
 Evolution, Genetic Algorithms and Threshold Accepting.
 There are also functions for the valuation of financial
 instruments, such as bonds and options, and functions that
 help with stochastic simulations.
