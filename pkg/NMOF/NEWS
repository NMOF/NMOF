Changes in Version 0.15-2

  o function 'gridSearch' now takes a list 'mc.control' as an argument;
    it allows to pass settings to 'mclapply' 
  o more tests were added (see unitTests.R)
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

Changes in Version 0.15-1

  o more tests were added (see unitTests.R)
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

Changes in Version 0.15-0

  o function 'gridSearch' can now evaluate a function that expects 
    a list or a vector as its first argument
  o test cases for 'gridSearch' added  (in unitTests/unitTests.R)
  o 'DEopt' can take a vector 'F' to set specific step sizes for each 
    decision variable (this actually worked before but is now documented 
    and tested) 
  o 'PSopt' can take a function 'changeV' and a logical 'loopChangeV' 
    (passed via the list 'algo'); 'changeV' allows to impose restrictions 
    on the velocity (see the code in directory NMOFex for an example) 
  o more checks were added in opt-functions
  o small changes in the vignettes (in particular, seeds are set now)
  o minor changes in documentation/examples

Changes in Version 0.14-2

  o experimental: 'gridSearch' now an has argument 'multicore'; if TRUE, 
    the function calls 'mclapply' (from the multicore package) to 
    evaluate argument 'fun'. Currently added only for cross-platform 
    testing (in particular, to see how R CMD check reacts under Windows). 
  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o small correction in output of 'TAopt'

Changes in Version 0.14-1

  o test cases for portfolio optimisation added (in unitTests/unitTests.R)

Changes in Version 0.14-0

  o function 'gridSearch' was added

Changes in Version 0.13-6

  o an initial population in 'DEopt', 'GAopt' and 'PSopt' is now passed
    through 'algo$initP' (before, a population could be passed via 'algo$mP')
  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o documentation was updated

Changes in Version 0.13-5

  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o internal changes in several functions
  o GAopt.Rd was updated

Changes in Version 0.13-4

  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o minor internal changes in several functions

Changes in Version 0.13-3

  o directory NMOFex was added; it contains the code for 
    'Examples and Extensions for the NMOF package'
  o documentation updated; minor changes in examples and vignettes

Changes in Version 0.13-2

  o documentation, checks, unit tests added for function 'GAopt'
  
Changes in Version 0.13-1

  o the population in 'GAopt' is now of mode logical (mistaking a logical
    vector for a numeric one is less harmful than the other way around)

Changes in Version 0.13-0

  o function 'GAopt' added (minimisation by a Genetic Algorithm)
  o several unit tests added
  o documentation revised (thanks to Manfred Gilli for comments)
  
Changes in Version 0.12-9

  o fewer simulation runs in vignettes to reduce build time
  
Changes in Version 0.12-1

  o documentation has been revised

Changes in Version 0.11-1

  o a number of test functions have been added (see ?testFunctions)
  o new examples added for 'DEopt' and 'TAopt'
  o vignettes have been revised

Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o opt-functions now have 'printBar' and 'printDetail' option (set via 'algo')
