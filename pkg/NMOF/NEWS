v0.17-0  (2011-09-18)

  o functions for Gaussian integration added: 'xwGauss' computes nodes and 
    weights; 'changeInterval' transforms the nodes/weights to arbitrary 
    intervals. Currently, only method 'legendre' is supported.
  o documentation updated
  o more tests added for opt-functions (for returned objects 'Fmat'
    and 'xlist')

v0.16-2  (2011-09-17)

  o all opt-functions now have arguments 'storeF' and 'storeSolutions'
    (passed through 'algo'). If the latter is TRUE, intermediary results
    will be stored in a list 'xlist' that is returned by the function
    (what exactly 'xlist' contains, depends on the specific function)
  o minor revision in vignette 'Robust Regression with
    Particle Swarm Optimisation and Differential Evolution'
  o NEWS file can now be found under inst/NEWS.Rd
  o internal changes: a number of test utilities have been added
    (not exported); see, for instance, ?checkList

v0.16-1  (2011-09-13)

  o fixed: 'bracketing' had not been added to the NAMESPACE file (now it is)
  o tests for 'bracketing' added (see directory unitTests)

v0.16-0  (2011-09-12)

  o function 'bracketing' added
  o minor changes in function 'MA' (added checks)

v0.15-6  (2011-09-11)

  o vignette for 'qTable' added/corrected

v0.15-5  (2011-09-04)

  o 'qTable' revised (user-specified labels are now possible)
  o (very) short vignette for 'qTable' added
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

v0.15-4

  o experimental: 'DEopt' takes further arguments 'storeF' and 'storeSolutions'
    (through list 'algo'). If 'storeF' is FALSE, objective function values are
    not stored ('Fmat' is set to NA; see ?DEopt). If 'storeSolutions' is TRUE,
    all population matrices are stored for every generation. This should be
    helpful for diagnostic checking (and demonstration purposes), but may use
    up a lot of memory for larger problems; hence default is FALSE.
    (These settings will either be removed from 'DEopt' or be added to all
    opt-functions in one of the next package versions.)

v0.15-3

  o new vignette ('Vectorised objective functions') added
  o more safeguards added to 'gridSearch'

v0.15-2

  o function 'gridSearch' now takes a list 'mc.control' as an argument;
    it allows to pass settings to 'mclapply'
  o more tests were added (see unitTests.R)
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

v0.15-1

  o more tests were added (see unitTests.R)
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

v0.15-0

  o function 'gridSearch' can now evaluate a function that expects
    a list or a vector as its first argument
  o test cases for 'gridSearch' added  (in unitTests/unitTests.R)
  o 'DEopt' can take a vector 'F' to set specific step sizes for each
    decision variable (this actually worked before but is now documented
    and tested)
  o 'PSopt' can take a function 'changeV' and a logical 'loopChangeV'
    (passed via the list 'algo'); 'changeV' allows to impose restrictions
    on the velocity (see the code in directory NMOFex for an example)
  o more checks were added in opt-functions
  o small changes in the vignettes (in particular, seeds are set now)
  o minor changes in documentation/examples

v0.14-2

  o experimental: 'gridSearch' now an has argument 'multicore'; if TRUE,
    the function calls 'mclapply' (from the multicore package) to
    evaluate argument 'fun'. Currently added only for cross-platform
    testing (in particular, to see how R CMD check reacts under Windows).
  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o small correction in output of 'TAopt'

v0.14-1

  o test cases for portfolio optimisation added (in unitTests/unitTests.R)

v0.14-0

  o function 'gridSearch' was added

v0.13-6

  o an initial population in 'DEopt', 'GAopt' and 'PSopt' is now passed
    through 'algo$initP' (before, a population could be passed via 'algo$mP')
  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o documentation was updated

v0.13-5

  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o internal changes in several functions
  o GAopt.Rd was updated

v0.13-4

  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o minor internal changes in several functions

v0.13-3

  o directory NMOFex was added; it contains the code for
    'Examples and Extensions for the NMOF package'
  o documentation updated; minor changes in examples and vignettes

v0.13-2

  o documentation, checks, unit tests added for function 'GAopt'

v0.13-1

  o the population in 'GAopt' is now of mode logical (mistaking a logical
    vector for a numeric one is less harmful than the other way around)

v0.13-0

  o function 'GAopt' added (minimisation by a Genetic Algorithm)
  o several unit tests added
  o documentation revised (thanks to Manfred Gilli for comments)

v0.12-9

  o fewer simulation runs in vignettes to reduce build time

v0.12-1

  o documentation has been revised

v0.11-1

  o a number of test functions have been added (see ?testFunctions)
  o new examples added for 'DEopt' and 'TAopt'
  o vignettes have been revised

v0.10-1

  o opt-functions now have 'printBar' and 'printDetail' option (set via 'algo')
