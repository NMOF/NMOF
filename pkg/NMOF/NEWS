v0.22-0  (2011-12-08)

  o documentation updated
  o slight changes in vignette 'DEnss.Rnw' (to reduce time 
    to build package)

v0.21-5  (2011-12-01)

  o fixed: in 'GAopt', optional arguments for 'mclapply' 
    (multicore) were not passed. An example for passing an 
    argument was added to file 'unitTests/multicore.R'.
  o documentation for 'GAopt' updated
  o code examples in subdirectory 'NMOFex' updated

v0.21-4  (2011-11-29)

  o 'GAopt' now has an argument 'algo$methodOF' that supports  
    'loop' (default) but also 'snow' or 'multicore'. See 
    'Examples and Extensions for the NMOF package'(with code 
    in subdirectory 'NMOFex') for an example.
  o vignette 'TAportfolio' updated (now with example for 
    rank-deficient matrix)

v0.21-3  (2011-11-25)

  o fixed: 'gridSearch' with 'printDetail=TRUE' did not give
    a meaningful message
  o experimental: 'GAopt' now has an argument 'algo$methodOF' 
    that can be 'loop' (default) but also 'snow' or 'multicore'
    (currently, only 'snow' is operational). If 'algo$methodOF' 
    is not 'loop', the evaluation of the objective function will 
    be distributed. See 'Examples and Extensions for the NMOF 
    package'(with code in subdirectory 'NMOFex') for an example.

v0.21-2  (2011-11-22)

  o fixed: with 'printDetail' greater than zero, 'TAopt' did
    not print the best solution, but the current solution
    (but internal book keeping worked correctly, and the best
    solution was returned)
  o 'bracketing', 'gridSearch', 'restartOpt': when 'cl' argument 
    is not NULL, then argument 'method' is set to 'snow' (but as 
    before it is checked whether package 'snow' is available)
  o the latest pdf-version of 'Examples and Extensions
    for the NMOF package' is now available from
    http://enricoschumann.net/files/NMOFex.pdf
  o code examples in subdirectory 'NMOFex' updated


v0.21-1  (2011-11-15)

  o the 'printDetail' option for opt-functions is now more consistent:
    a positive integer 'i' greater than one means that information
    is printed at every 'i'th iteration
  o minor changes in vignettes
  o unit tests for 'callCF' added (in file 'unitTests/unitTests5.R')

v0.21-0  (2011-11-08)

  o added function 'callCF' as a wrapper for pricing
    European calls with the characteristic function;
    characteristic functions for BSM, Merton, Bates, Heston
    and Variance-Gamma were also added
  o when 'algo$q' in 'TAopt' is zero, all thresholds are set
    to zero
  o code examples in subdirectory 'NMOFex' updated
  o CITATION file now points to the book's homepage http://nmof.net

v0.20-1  (2011-10-28)

  o the 'keepNames' argument of function 'gridSearch' is now
    supported
  o more examples added for 'gridSearch' (and corresponding tests
    in 'unitTests/unitTests2.R')
  o fixed: some typos in vignette 'Vectorised objective functions'

v0.20-0  (2011-10-20)

  o *first CRAN release*
  o the 'printDetail' argument for 'LSopt' now recognises
    TRUE and FALSE (as before), but also an integer 'i'
    greater than 1. In the latter case, information on the best
    solution is printed at every 'i'th step.
  o minor cleanups in documentation

v0.19-4  (2011-10-15)

  o small changes in vignette 'Repairing solutions'
  o small internal changes in 'GAopt' and 'DEopt' (auxiliary functions
    like 'switch' and 'shift' have been inlined)
  o code examples in subdirectory 'NMOFex' updated

v0.19-3  (2011-10-07)

  o fixed: a bug had been introduced into 'GAopt' in version 0.19-2
    (revision 88), which let the population grow to algo$nP+1
  o minor changes in documentation/examples

v0.19-2  (2011-09-30)

  o minor cleanups in documentation

v0.19-1  (2011-09-29)

  o minor cleanups in documentation
  o minor internal changes in 'restartOpt' (passing of the '...' arguments
    for method 'snow')

v0.19-0  (2011-09-26)

  o 'bracketing', 'gridSearch' and 'restartOpt' now support distributed
    evaluation of 'fun' via 'clusterApply' from the 'snow' package. As a
    side effect, the interface of 'gridSearch' and 'restartOpt' has
    changed: instead of an option 'multicore', they now have an argument
    'method', which can be 'loop', 'multicore' or 'snow'. See the
    documentation of these functions.
  o for consistency, the 'method' argument of 'bracketing' expects 'vectorised'
    rather than 'vectorise' (but both work, and also the '-ize' spellings)
  o substantial revision of documentation/examples
  o more intelligible error/warning messages in 'bracketing' added
  o small changes in vignettes 'Robust Regression with Particle Swarm
    Optimisation and Differential Evolution' and 'Repairing solutions'
  o file 'multicore.R' was moved to subdirectory inst/unitTests;
    thus, it is installed with the package. Some tests for package 'snow'
    were added.
  o more tests added (subdirectory unitTests); in particular, tests are
    more comprehensively commented now

v0.18-1  (2011-09-21)

  o fixed: 'restartOpt' with 'multicore = TRUE' did not correctly
    pass '...' arguments to 'fun'
  o fixed: typo in message issued by 'gridSearch'
  o new file 'multicore.R' added in subdirectory tests; it contains a number
    of timing tests to see if the 'multicore' option works. (The tests are
    not run when the package is built.)
  o minor updates in documentation

v0.18-0  (2011-09-20)

  o 'restartOpt' now has option 'multicore'
  o the 'method' option of function 'xwGauss' can now take on values
    'hermite' and 'laguerre'
  o documentation updated
  o new examples added in 'Examples and Extensions for the NMOF package'
    (see subdirectory NMOFex)
  o test cases added for 'restartOpt' and 'xwGauss'
    (see subdirectory unitTests)

v0.17-0  (2011-09-18)

  o functions for Gaussian integration added: 'xwGauss' computes nodes and
    weights; 'changeInterval' transforms the nodes/weights to arbitrary
    intervals. Currently, only method 'legendre' is supported.
  o documentation updated
  o more tests added for opt-functions (for returned objects 'Fmat'
    and 'xlist')

v0.16-2  (2011-09-17)

  o all opt-functions now have arguments 'storeF' and 'storeSolutions'
    (passed through 'algo'). If the latter is TRUE, intermediary results
    will be stored in a list 'xlist' that is returned by the function
    (what exactly 'xlist' contains, depends on the specific function)
  o minor revision in vignette 'Robust Regression with
    Particle Swarm Optimisation and Differential Evolution'
  o NEWS file can now be found under inst/NEWS.Rd
  o internal changes: a number of test utilities have been added
    (not exported); see, for instance, ?checkList

v0.16-1  (2011-09-13)

  o fixed: 'bracketing' had not been added to the NAMESPACE file (now it is)
  o tests for 'bracketing' added (see directory unitTests)

v0.16-0  (2011-09-12)

  o function 'bracketing' added
  o minor changes in function 'MA' (added checks)

v0.15-6  (2011-09-11)

  o vignette for 'qTable' added/corrected

v0.15-5  (2011-09-04)

  o 'qTable' revised (user-specified labels are now possible)
  o (very) short vignette for 'qTable' added
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

v0.15-4

  o experimental: 'DEopt' takes further arguments 'storeF' and 'storeSolutions'
    (through list 'algo'). If 'storeF' is FALSE, objective function values are
    not stored ('Fmat' is set to NA; see ?DEopt). If 'storeSolutions' is TRUE,
    all population matrices are stored for every generation. This should be
    helpful for diagnostic checking (and demonstration purposes), but may use
    up a lot of memory for larger problems; hence default is FALSE.
    (These settings will either be removed from 'DEopt' or be added to all
    opt-functions in one of the next package versions.)

v0.15-3

  o new vignette ('Vectorised objective functions') added
  o more safeguards added to 'gridSearch'

v0.15-2

  o function 'gridSearch' now takes a list 'mc.control' as an argument;
    it allows to pass settings to 'mclapply'
  o more tests were added (see unitTests.R)
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

v0.15-1

  o more tests were added (see unitTests.R)
  o minor changes in code/documentation/examples

v0.15-0

  o function 'gridSearch' can now evaluate a function that expects
    a list or a vector as its first argument
  o test cases for 'gridSearch' added  (in unitTests/unitTests.R)
  o 'DEopt' can take a vector 'F' to set specific step sizes for each
    decision variable (this actually worked before but is now documented
    and tested)
  o 'PSopt' can take a function 'changeV' and a logical 'loopChangeV'
    (passed via the list 'algo'); 'changeV' allows to impose restrictions
    on the velocity (see the code in directory NMOFex for an example)
  o more checks were added in opt-functions
  o small changes in the vignettes (in particular, seeds are set now)
  o minor changes in documentation/examples

v0.14-2

  o experimental: 'gridSearch' now an has argument 'multicore'; if TRUE,
    the function calls 'mclapply' (from the multicore package) to
    evaluate argument 'fun'. Currently added only for cross-platform
    testing (in particular, to see how R CMD check reacts under Windows).
  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o small correction in output of 'TAopt'

v0.14-1

  o test cases for portfolio optimisation added (in unitTests/unitTests.R)

v0.14-0

  o function 'gridSearch' was added

v0.13-6

  o an initial population in 'DEopt', 'GAopt' and 'PSopt' is now passed
    through 'algo$initP' (before, a population could be passed via 'algo$mP')
  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o documentation was updated

v0.13-5

  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o internal changes in several functions
  o GAopt.Rd was updated

v0.13-4

  o directory NMOFex was updated
  o minor internal changes in several functions

v0.13-3

  o directory NMOFex was added; it contains the code for
    'Examples and Extensions for the NMOF package'
  o documentation updated; minor changes in examples and vignettes

v0.13-2

  o documentation, checks, unit tests added for function 'GAopt'

v0.13-1

  o the population in 'GAopt' is now of mode logical (mistaking a logical
    vector for a numeric one is less harmful than the other way around)

v0.13-0

  o function 'GAopt' added (minimisation by a Genetic Algorithm)
  o several unit tests added
  o documentation revised (thanks to Manfred Gilli for comments)

v0.12-9

  o fewer simulation runs in vignettes to reduce build time

v0.12-1

  o documentation has been revised

v0.11-1

  o a number of test functions have been added (see ?testFunctions)
  o new examples added for 'DEopt' and 'TAopt'
  o vignettes have been revised

v0.10-1

  o opt-functions now have 'printBar' and 'printDetail' option
    (set via 'algo')
