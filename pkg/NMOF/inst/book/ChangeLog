        * ModelingDependencies (Gaussian2.R, line 29): "cor(Y)" replaced
	by "cor(Xc)"

        * EconometricModels (example1.R, example3data.R): added
        "if(is.na())" in OF (as a safeguard if "lambda" gets negative
        during the search)

        
About this file
        This ChangeLog reports how the R-files in the package have been
	changed compared with the versions printed in the book. The file
	is only updated when substantive changes have been made (adding
	space or comments is not a substantive change). Note that in the
	R-files all expressions of the type "all.equal(x, y)" have been
	replaced with "stopifnot(all.equal(x, y))". Running such files via
	"source" will then stop with an error if a FALSE occurs.

	If you find errors in the files, please report them to
	<enricoschumann@yahoo.de> .
