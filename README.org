* Numerical Methods and Optimisation in Finance

  The NMOF package provides many of the code examples and
  data sets used in the book "Numerical Methods and
  Optimization in Finance" by M. Gilli, D. Maringer and
  E. Schumann (2011), ISBN 978-0123756626. The package also
  contains several functions that have not been described in
  the book. Notably, the package provides implementations of
  a number of optimisation heuristics, among them
  Differential Evolution and Genetic Algorithms. There are
  also functions for valuing financial instruments such as
  bonds and options, and helper functions for stochastic
  simulations.

** Installing the package

   The latest build of the package is always available from
   [[http://enricoschumann.net/R/packages/NMOF/index.htm]] A
   stable version is available from [[https://cran.r-project.org/][CRAN]].

   To install the package from within an R session, type:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval never :export code
install.packages('NMOF')  ## CRAN version
install.packages('NMOF', type = 'source',
                 repos = c('http://enricoschumann.net/R', getOption('repos')))
#+END_SRC

** News, feedback and discussion

   New package releases and other news related to the book
   or the package are announced on the =NMOF-news= mailing
   list:
   [[https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nmof-news]]

Applications, as long as they are finance-related, should be
discussed on the =R-SIG-Finance= mailing list:
[[https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-finance]]


Please send bug reports or suggestions directly to the
package maintainer, for instance by using \texttt{bug.report}.
