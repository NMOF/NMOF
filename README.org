* NMOF -- Numerical Methods and Optimisation in Finance


The NMOF package provides many of the code examples and data sets used
in Gilli, Maringer and Schumann (2011); it also contains several
functions that have not been described in the book. Notably, the
package provides implementations of a number of optimisation
heuristics, among them Differential Evolution and Genetic Algorithms.
There are also functions for valuing financial instruments such as
bonds and options and helper functions for stochastic simulations.
